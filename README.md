# Face Recognition from Device's Webcam
This project is built upon the [Siamese Research Paper.](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/oneshot1.pdf)
### Features
* __One-shot__ Face Recognition
* Trained with __Binary Cross Entropy__ and __Gradient Descent__ as Loss Functions
* Employed __Adam__ as the optimizer
* Tested with accuracy metrics like __Precision__ and __Recall__
* Utilized __Data Augmentation__ for better Accuracy (Constantly Evolving)
* Implemented the __Kivy Module__ in Python for an enhanced User Experience
### To get Started
